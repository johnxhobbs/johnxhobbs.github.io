## Purpose

After a couple of decades of finding and making lots of things which I find interesting, it's time to see whether anyone else beyond [Jeremy Corbyn agrees](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-56281464).

## Best Intentions

It's got to be said up-front that this site, and associated links, will be updated very sporadically. This will depend on how busy I've been: 

 - too busy and there will not be sufficient time to get things down
 - not busy enough and there will be no new ideas to share

In this _Goldilocks dilemma_, it will remain a rare treat for now.
